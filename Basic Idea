Output should show something like as follows

for each plane
#Name or Flight Number (for each class #Rows #Columns) #Length of flight #Base price

for each person
#Name
#ID
#Days Early
#Class
#Related People's ID or Name
(for each flight in the itenerary #Flight number)

Should a flight be canceled for some reason or another, vertex cover would help move the passenger from the cancelled
flight to a new flight of semi optimal pattern with minimal layover.
A simple equation for this could be ((Layover)*(Number of Flights))/(Flight Time)

A method in the person class could move the person from one flight to the next.
