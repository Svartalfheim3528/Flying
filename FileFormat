//This is what I think the file format should maybe look like, can edit it in the future.

FLIGHT#   ROWS  COLUMNS   DEPARTURECITY   ARRIVALCITY   DEPARTURETIME   ARRIVALTIME
PASSID  PASSID  PASSID...

//So the PASSID's are passenger ID's, and they
//are going to tell you where to look for the passenger's
//file, which is going to hold all of the passenger's details.

//The passenger's files will just be an ID text file, i.e. "123456789.txt"
//This will hold their itinerary, ID, Seat Class, etc.

//Alternatively to the ROWS/COLUMNS, we could include an identifyer for
//plane which tells us the rows/columns already, and that way we don't need
//to figure out the info for every single plane, it'll all be pre-stored.

//Edit after this if you have additions or changes you want to do
