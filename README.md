So basically, at the basic "manager" you can see "Branches" of
the existing files, and these branches are copies of whatever
you've done up to this point.  So what I think we should do is 
every time we put any work into this, create a new "branch".
This will be helpful because we can use it to do the documentation
of who did what, and in case we majorly mess up we can go back to it.

I think I'm going to create a couple new text-only documents just for
questions we can have for each other, so we can write them down
as we think of them.
